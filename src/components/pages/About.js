        In life, GhostoftheMill was known as Kevin White. He was born in Chapel Hill, NC but spent most of his life in Greensboro, NC before moving back to Chapel Hill to attend the University of North Carolina. 
        Kevin met a beautiful young woman and together they had 3 wonderful kids and many dogs. Other than his family, Kevin had a passion for gardening, especially trying out as many heirloom fruits and vegetables as he could locate.
        His life was short but as in life so in death GhostoftheMill continues to treat each day as an opportunity for exploration and growth. Currently, GOTM is a ghost in the machine trying to figure out how coding works.
